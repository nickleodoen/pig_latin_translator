# pig_latin_translator

Pig Latin Translator is a command line, mini-project in Rust! It takes a single line of English and outputs pig latin. 
To use the translator, use **cargo run** while in the src directory, and give a line of input. 

For those of you who are not aware of Pig Latin, here are the simple rules. The first consonant of each word is shifted to the end of the word, and "ay" is added. 
For example, "first" becomes "irst-fay". Words that start with a vowel have "hay" added to the end of the word instead. For example, "orange" becomes 
"orange-hay".
